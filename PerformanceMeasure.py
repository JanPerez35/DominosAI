class PerformanceTracker:
    """
    Tracks and reports performance statistics for various game modes in a domino game.

    This class maintains statistics such as the number of games played, win counts,
    tie counts, and average scores for individual players or teams across multiple game
    modes. The report method prints a formatted performance summary based on the
    current mode.

    Supported Game Modes:
        - "1v1": One human vs one AI.
        - "2v2": Two humans vs two AIs. Human and AI positions may vary across games.
        - "3v1": Three humans vs one AI.
        - "1v3": One human vs three AIs.
        - Other (not listed in the report but handled internally):
            * "AI vs AI": Two AIs playing against each other.
            * "4 AI": All four players are AIs competing against each other.
